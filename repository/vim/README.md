# Extension

Plugins are loaded by https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

## Android support

Several options are available, not all are working however listing them for
reference. 

### vim-android + ALE + kotlin-language-server

Note: It seems kotlin-language-server is slower than Java.
Setup is identical as with java-language-server. Just add kotlin ftplugin with
different linter and server executable:
```
g:ale_linters = {'kotlin': ['ktlint', 'languageserver', 'android']}
let g:ale_kotlin_languageserver_executable = 'kotlin-language-server'
```

* Install https://github.com/fwcd/kotlin-language-server 
    * Required by ALE
    * Arch Linux package https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kotlin-language-server-git/
* Install https://github.com/udalov/kotlin-vim 
    * Provide code syntax highlighting

### vim-android + ALE + java-language-server

Available features: check Java syntax, GoToDefinition, code completion,
auto-import, code formatting. Missing a fuzzy code completion which might be
implemented in future: https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/issues/2208

Note, there is known bug in VIM: https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/8974 Unable
to view zip files (jar as well). That affects GoToDefinition command from ALE.
In addition a plugin https://github.com/bogado/file-line.git also affects
opening zip/jar files. Don't use it.

    * Fuzzy syntax completion
    * Optional dependency for ALE
    * Clone repository as usual. Pathogen will load plugin without problem

    " <TAB>: completion.
    inoremap <silent><expr> <TAB>
    \ ddc#map#pum_visible() ? '<C-n>' :
    \ (col('.') <= 1 <Bar><Bar> getline('.')[col('.') - 2] =~# '\s') ?
    \ '<TAB>' : ddc#map#manual_complete()
    " <S-TAB>: completion back.

    * Arch Linux package https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/checkstyle/

Provides syntax checker, recognizes Android packages but I couldn't find a
GoToDefinition support.

* Install Syntastic https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic
    * Enable javac support in _.vimrc_: `let g:syntastic_java_checkers=['javac']`
    * Plugin will provide syntax checker

    * Set in _.vimrc_ a path to Android SDK: `let g:android_sdk_path = "/opt/android-sdk"`

### YouCompleteMe

Doesn't support Android packages. Can't be used.
